This directory contains the Matlab(TM) code and natural image data to
reproduce most of the experiments on in chapters 1-11 and Section 13.1 
of the book "Natural Image Statistics" by Hyvarinen, Hurri, and Hoyer, 
published by Springer.
Code by Aapo Hyvarinen partly based on code by Patrik O. Hoyer 
  and rotavg.m code courtesy of Bruno Olshausen
This is version 1.0, 11 Dec 2008, run with Matlab 7.5.0

MAIN FILE: figures.m 
  Running this file will do all the main experiments

DATA DIRECTORY: data/
  This directory contains the natural images used in the experiments

SAMPLING: sampleimages.m  
  Sample patches from images in directory "data"

PREPROCESSING: removeDC.m      
  Remove DC from image patches
  Note: there is no single command for whitening the data, see figures.m
        on how to use the results from pca.m to whiten your data
  
MAIN ALGORITHMS:
 pca.m     %principal component analysis
 ica.m     %FastICA for whitened data
 isa_est.m %estimation of ISA model for whitened data
 tica.m    %estimation of topographic ICA for whitened data
 overcomplete.m %estimation of energy-based overcomplete model for whitened data


OTHER FILES:
 subroutines of the above, including plotting and terminal reporting commands.
